### 3. Project Configuration

- **Database**:
  Open `djangoblog/settings.py`, locate the `DATABASES` section, and update it with your MySQL connection details.

  ```python
  DATABASES = {
      'default': {
          'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
          'NAME': 'djangoblog',
          'USER': 'root',
          'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
          'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
          'PORT': 3306,
      }
  }
  ```
  Create the database in MySQL:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE `djangoblog` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
  ```

## Deployment

- **Traditional Deployment**: A detailed guide for server deployment is available here: [Deployment Tutorial](https://www.lylinux.net/article/2019/8/5/58.html) (in Chinese).
- **Docker Deployment**: This project fully supports Docker. If you are familiar with containerization, please refer to the [Docker Deployment Guide](/docs/docker-en.md) for a quick start.
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: We also provide a complete [Kubernetes Deployment Guide](/docs/k8s-en.md) to help you go cloud-native easily.

## üß© Plugin System

The plugin system is a core feature of DjangoBlog. It allows you to add new functionalities to your blog without modifying the core codebase by writing standalone plugins.

- **How it Works**: Plugins operate by registering callback functions to predefined "hooks". For instance, when an article is rendered, the `after_article_body_get` hook is triggered, and all functions registered to this hook are executed.
- **Existing Plugins**: Features like `view_count` and `seo_optimizer` are implemented through this plugin system.
- **Develop Your Own Plugin**: Simply create a new folder under the `plugins` directory and write your `plugin.py`. We welcome you to explore and contribute your creative ideas to the DjangoBlog community!
